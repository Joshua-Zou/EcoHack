          <p>Noise pollution is any man-made noise that is harmful to humans and the nature they're surrounded by. It can range from constructions sites all the way to traffic. And it's much more dangerous than you think. Medical News Today reports that "With continued exposure to noise pollution, a personâ€™s sensitivity to stress increases. People living with noise pollution may feel irritable, on edge, frustrated, or angry. If a person feels they cannot control the amount of noise in their environment, its impact on their mental health intensifies." It also hurts children. Medical News Today goes on to state that children exposed to more than 8 hours of noise pollution each day experience permanent hearing problems. <br><br> Furthermore, it also hurts the environment that we should be taking care of. National Geographic says "Animals use sound for a variety of reasons, including to navigate, find food, attract mates, and avoid predators. Noise pollution makes it difficult for them to accomplish these tasks, which affects their ability survive." Evidently, noise pollution hurts everyone. That's why we created SoundScale to fight it. <br> <br>SoundScale uses crowdsourcing to combat noise pollution by informing everyone about how much noise pollution there is across the globe. The concept is simple; anybody can submit data on how many decibels (a measurement for noise)of noise pollution they're experiencing. The website automatically detects their location and logs the data into our databases. Users can view the gathered data on the <a href = "https://ecohack.joshuazou.repl.co/maps?year=2021">map</a>, where it give comprehensive information on noise pollution across the globe. This map will be of great use to environmental groups, who will know where to focus their pollution reduction efforts. It can also be used to educate everyone on the widespread effects of noise pollution.</p>
