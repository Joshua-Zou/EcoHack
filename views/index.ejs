  <div class="content">
    <p>Medical News Today reports that "With continued exposure to noise pollution, a personâ€™s sensitivity to stress increases. People living with noise pollution may feel irritable, on edge, frustrated, or angry. If a person feels they cannot control the amount of noise in their environment, its impact on their mental health intensifies." It also hurts children.

  <summary>What is SoundScale?</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>SoundScale uses crowdsourcing to combat noise pollution by informing everyone about how much noise pollution there is across the globe. The concept is simple; anybody can submit data on how many decibels (a measurement for noise)of noise pollution they're experiencing. The website automatically detects their location and logs the data into our databases. Users can view the gathered data on the <a href = "https://ecohack.joshuazou.repl.co/maps?year=2021">map</a>, where it give comprehensive information on noise pollution across the globe. This map will be of great use to environmental groups, who will know where to focus their pollution reduction efforts. It can also be used to educate everyone on the widespread effects of noise pollution. </p>
